Hi there, just a quick note.

I didn't include any files for the Christmas sprites, as I'm currently trying to think of a colour scheme I could use to differentiate it from the regular sprites. It'll still be the same character-based recolour, but I just want to have more colour than the original in it.

In the mean time, enjoy this mod. If you have the original Soft mod, you can check 'em out in that as well. Just rename "Rokusho_Pico_Assets" to "GF_assets" and "Rokusho_Car_Assets" to "soft_pico_blow_car". The icons were recoloured in paint.NET, just copy the first icon there over the original Pico icon if you want to include icons as well.

By the way, credit for the Soft mod goes to its original creators! I've included a link back to the mod in the credits.
