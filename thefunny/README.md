Seven Foot Frame - Nextor. Meant for Dave and Bambi, in 3D world songs. Offsets listed in the offsets directory, you'll have to build from source to add the offsets.

blitz crimsus (HOLIDAYMOD) - Blitz, a Were-con. Also applies to the car file. It's a holiday mod BF reskin.

deckButWere2 - Ditto.

deckie - Decktop, in his Were-con form. Soft Pico reskin.

deckie_chrysler - Decktop, in his Mini-con form. Soft Pico christmas reskin. Unfinished atm

deckie2 - Apparently ditto with deckie, though I thought this was Mini-con form. I'm dumb. I'll figure it out later.

deckPixel - Used this with the You Can't Pan cover of You Can't Run in Vs Sonic.exe. It's Decktop in his Were-con form.

## Quick note
tinySusDot is literally just a tiny dot. You can use it, just give it a single animation called 'idle' with no sing anims. I use it in Psych Engine to work around trying to figure out GF positioning for characters that aren't the regular GF.
