# devin's FNF FLA repo

Hi there! This repo will contain FLA files for things that I mess around with. This includes BF reskins, recolours of other mods (that I pretty much only use in my own copies of said mods), and even original stuff. At the moment, it's all in the "thefunny" folder. I plan to organise this shit later, but I need to figure out how I'm organising it.

Offset lists will also be included in case a character has offsets that are different from their original, or is a new character with new offsets.

## The offsets folder
The character offsets folder will contain offset lists of characters that require them. If a character doesn't have an offset, just assume the default offsets in the mod or engine you play will work fine!

## Check out my Carrd.
My Carrd contains links to all my other social medias, and in the future will have a list of my OCs as well.
