# devin's FNF FLA repo || Funny mod shits branch

Hi there! This branch will contain random mods that I make.

You can find zip files in the zips directory, but each mod will have its own folder.

### Installing the mods in Psych Engine

Installing these mods in Psych Engine is super simple. Just extract the contents of a mod zip to the `mods` directory, then enable it in Psych Engine's Mods menu.

If you want to incorporate these into your own build of Psych Engine, feel free. A credit icon is included in each mod, and you can easily just copy or move that to `assets/preload/images/credits`.

**Please credit me if you choose to incorporate one of my mods into your builds. Same applies for YouTube videos. You can link the Carrd below, as it contains a link to my GitHub profile which will be more reliable than simply including a link to this repo.**

## Check out my Carrd.
My Carrd contains links to all my other social medias, and in the future will have a list of my OCs as well.
